# Enhanced Issue Tracking (Github)
### A pet project to redesign the issue tracking section for repositories, on Github.  

Over the next few days I will be starting with a clean slate. Researching, designing and coding my take on a fresh new look.

### Some Notes
* Github Shortcomings 
   * Github is designed with collaboration of code in mind, a very binary contruct. Design elements do not follow this principle, making it hard to commit design changes along the way. For this reason I will be uploading all my design files at the end.
   
* Research
   * As a fairly new developer, I have not had a great deal of experience with the issue tracker on Github, nor have I had the time to find out, first hand, its problems. To be able to come up with a suitable upgrade to its design I will have to do research before we begin, and make some assumptions about the system as a whole. These assumptions will be committed in an "assumptions.txt" file once research is complete.
   

### The Process

As a whole, to gaurantee success I will be following a design process and workflow based on quick and iterative changes. This pathway will be as follows;

 - [x] Set up project files, and find clear guidelines for the problem.
 - [x] Research and document personal take away's and public opinions online.
 - [x] Sketch / Mockup concept ideas.
 - [x] Digital Mockup in Illustrator (Also provides DOM overview)
 - [x] Create Code Overview Based on Findings
 - [ ] Code Sprints (Code, Test, Review, Repeat)
 - [ ] Review Documents for Legibility and Standards
 - [ ] Complete / Launch
